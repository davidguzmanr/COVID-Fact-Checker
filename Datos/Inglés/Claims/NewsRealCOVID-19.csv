vaccines for every country in world rich and poor to make rapid progress towards slowing pandemic interest from governments representing more than 60 of worlds population offers tremendous vote of confidence in effort to ensure truly global access to covid-19 vaccines once developedgeneva london 15 july 2020 seventy five countries have submitted expressions of interest to protect their populations and those of other nations through joining covax facility mechanism designed to guarantee rapid fair and equitable access to covid-19 vaccines worldwide. 75 countries which would finance vaccines from their own public finance budgets partner with up to 90 lower income countries that could be supported through voluntary donations to gavis covax advance market commitment amc. together this group of up to 165 countries represents more than 60 of worlds population. among group are representatives from every continent and more than half of worlds g20 economies. covax is only truly global solution to covid-19 pandemic said dr seth berkley ceo of gavi vaccine alliance. for vast majority of countries whether they can afford to pay for their own doses or require assistance it means receiving guaranteed share of doses and avoiding being pushed to back of queue as we saw during h1n1 pandemic decade ago. even for those countries that are able to secure their own agreements with vaccine manufacturers this mechanism represents through its world leading portfolio of vaccine candidates means of reducing risks associated with individual candidates failing to show efficacy or gain licensure. covax facility forms key part of covax pillar covax of access to covid-19 tools act accelerator ground breaking global collaboration to accelerate development production and equitable access to covid-19 tests treatments and vaccines. covax is co led by gavi coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi and who working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers. covax aims to accelerate development and manufacture of covid-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in world. it will achieve this by sharing risks associated with vaccine development investing in manufacturing upfront so vaccines can be deployed at scale as soon as they are proven successful and pooling procurement and purchasing power to achieve sufficient volumes to end acute phase of pandemic by 2021. this early level of interest represents tremendous vote of confidence in covax and our shared goal to protect people around globe through fair allocation of covid-19 vaccine said dr richard hatchett ceo of cepi. covax offers innovative solution to gravest public health crisis in living memory. it will speed up availability of safe and effective vaccines through early investment in manufacturing capacity and maximise chances of success by backing broad and diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates. through covax our aspiration is to be able to vaccinate most vulnerable 20 of population of every country that participates regardless of income level by end of 2021. ensuring fair access is not only matter of equity it is fastest way to end this pandemic goal of covax is by end of 2021 to deliver two billion doses of safe effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or who prequalification. these vaccines will be delivered equally to all participating countries proportional to their populations initially prioritising healthcare workers then expanding to cover 20 of population of participating countries. further doses will then be made available based on country need vulnerability and covid-19 threat. covax facility will also maintain buffer of doses for emergency and humanitarian use including dealing with severe outbreaks before they spiral out of control. covid-19 pandemic like every health crisis also presents us with opportunities said dr soumya swaminathan who chief scientist. vaccine that is affordable and accessible to all will help us address systemic health inequalities. we need all countries to support covax to achieve this goal and bring end to acute phase of pandemic. success of these efforts will ultimately depend on securing enough funding from governments and commitments from vaccine manufacturers to participate at scale large enough to deliver global solution. formal expressions of interest submitted are non binding covax pillar will now begin process of consultation with all 165 countries with countries funding vaccines through their own domestic budgets being required to provide upfront payment and commitment to purchase doses by end of august to secure involvement in covax facility. significant progress has been achieved by covax partners to date with seven of nine candidate vaccines supported by cepi already in clinical trials. memorandum of understanding with astrazeneca also commits them to supply 300 million doses of covid-19 vaccines to covax. in addition in june gavi launched covax advance market commitment amc financing instrument aimed at incentivising vaccine manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of eventual covid-19 vaccines to ensure access for developing countries. amc has already raised close to us$ 600 million against initial target of us$ 2 billion from high income donors as well as private sector. gavi alliance will also work with developing countries to assure readiness of supply and cold chain and training to reach high risk groups. notes to editorsthe countries submitting expressions

https://www.who.int/news/item/15-07-2020-who-and-unicef-warn-of-a-decline-in-vaccinations-during-covid-19,geneva new york 15 july 2020 world health organization and unicef warned today of alarming decline in number of children receiving life saving vaccines around world. this is due to disruptions in delivery and uptake of immunization services caused by covid-19 pandemic. according to new data by who and unicef these disruptions threaten to reverse hard won progress to reach more children and adolescents with wider range of vaccines which has already been hampered by decade of stalling coverage. latest data on vaccine coverage estimates from who and unicef for 2019 shows that improvements such as expansion of hpv vaccine to 106 countries and greater protection for children against more diseases are in danger of lapsing. for example preliminary data for first four months of 2020 points to substantial drop in number of children completing three doses of vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis dtp3. this is first time in 28 years that world could see reduction in dtp3 coverage marker for immunization coverage within and across countries. vaccines are one of most powerful tools in history of public health and more children are now being immunized than ever before said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. but pandemic has put those gains at risk. avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunizations could be far greater than covid-19 itself. but it does nt have to be that way. vaccines can be delivered safely even during pandemic and we are calling on countries to ensure these essential life saving programmes continue. covid-19 disruptions due to covid-19 pandemic at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns were or are at risk of being cancelled which could result in further outbreaks in 2020 and beyond. according to new unicef who and gavi pulse survey conducted in collaboration with us centers for disease control sabin vaccine institute and johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health three quarters of 82 countries that responded reported covid-19 related disruptions in their immunization programmes as of may 2020. reasons for disrupted services vary. even when services are offered people are either unable to access them because of reluctance to leave home transport interruptions economic hardships restrictions on movement or fear of being exposed to people with covid-19. many health workers are also unavailable because of restrictions on travel or redeployment to covid response duties as well as lack of protective equipment. covid-19 has made previously routine vaccination daunting challenge said unicef executive director henrietta fore. we must prevent further deterioration in vaccine coverage and urgently resume vaccination programs before childrens lives are threatened by other diseases. we can not trade one health crisis for another. stagnating global coverage rate progress on immunization coverage was stalling before covid-19 hit at 85 per cent for dtp3 and measles vaccines. likelihood that child born today will be fully vaccinated with all globally recommended vaccines by time she reaches age of 5 is less than 20 per cent. in 2019 nearly 14 million children missed out on life saving vaccines such as measles and dtp3. most of these children live in africa and are likely to lack access to other health services. two thirds of them are concentrated in 10 middle- and low income countries angola brazil democratic republic of congo ethiopia india indonesia mexico nigeria pakistan and philippines. children in middle income countries account for increasing share of burden. progress and challenges by country and region there has been some progress. regional coverage for third dose of dtp in south asia has increased by 12 percentage points over last 10 years notably across india nepal and pakistan. however that hard won progress could be undone by covid-19 related disruptions. countries that had recorded significant progress such as ethiopia and pakistan are now also at risk of backsliding if immunization services are not restored as soon as feasible. situation is especially concerning for latin america and caribbean where historically high coverage has slipped over last decade. in brazil bolivia haiti and venezuela immunization coverage plummeted by at least 14 percentage points since 2010. these countries are now also confronting moderate to severe covid19-related disruptions. as global health community attempts to recover lost ground due to covid-19 related disruptions unicef and who are supporting countries in their efforts to reimagine immunization and build back better by restoring services so countries can safely deliver routine immunization services during covid-19 pandemic by adhering to hygiene and physical distancing recommendations and providing protective equipment to health workers helping health workers communicate actively with caregivers to explain how services have been reconfigured to ensure safety;rectifying coverage and immunity gaps expanding routine services to reach missed communities where some of most vulnerable children live. notes to editorsdownload photos report data files and b roll from unicef here or from who here. after 2 pm cet 15 july

we are doing in reaching every child with life saving vaccines. in addition to producing immunization coverage estimates for 2019 who and unicef estimation process revises entire historical series of immunization data with latest available information. 2019 revision covers 39 years of coverage estimates from 1980 to 2019. dtp3 coverage is used as indicator to assess proportion of children vaccinated and is calculated for children under one year of age. estimated number of vaccinated children are calculated using population data provided by 2019 world population prospects wpp from un. fact sheet.immunization pulse survey june 2020the new unicef who and gavi pulse survey was conducted in collaboration with us centers for disease control sabin vaccine institute and johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health in june 2020. respondents from 82 countries including 14 with lower than 80 per cent vaccination coverage rates in 2019 reported on disruptions in immunization services due to covid-19 as of may 2020. online immunization pulse survey received responses from 260 immunization experts including representatives of ministries of health academia and global health organizations across 82 countries. previous pulse poll conducted in april received 801 responses from 107 countries showed that disruption to routine immunization programs were already widespread and affected all regions. 64 per cent of countries represented in that poll indicated that routine immunizations had been disrupted or even suspended. world health organization provides global leadership

https://www.who.int/news/item/09-07-2020-independent-evaluation-of-global-covid-19-response-announced,who director general today announced initiation of independent panel for pandemic preparedness and response ippr to evaluate worlds response to covid-19 pandemic.in remarks to who member states director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said panel will be co chaired by former prime minister of new zealand helen clark and former president of liberia ellen johnson sirleaf. prime minister clark went to on lead united nations development programme and president sirleaf is recipient of nobel peace prize.operating independently they will choose other panel members as well as members of independent secretariat to provide support.prime minister clark and president sirleaf were selected through process of broad consultation with member states and world experts. i can not imagine two more strong minded independent leaders to help guide us through this critical learning process. said dr. tedros in his speech.at historic 73rd world health assembly in may member states adopted landmark resolutionthat called on who to initiate independent and comprehensive evaluation of lessons learned from international health response to covid-19.this is time for self reflection to look at world we live in and to find ways to strengthen our collaboration as we work together to save lives and bring this pandemic under control said dr tedros. magnitude of this pandemic which has touched virtually everyone in world clearly deserves commensurate evaluation. dr tedros proposed that special session of executive board be called in september to discuss panels progress. in november panel will present interim report at resumption of world health assembly.in january 2021 executive board will hold its regular session where panels work will be further discussed and in may of next year at world health assembly panel will present its substantive report.the director general noted that independent oversight and advisory committee for who health emergencies programme will also continue its existing work.even as we fight this pandemic we must be readying ourselves for future global outbreaks and many other challenges of our time such as antimicrobial resistance inequality and climate crisis said dr tedros. covid-19 has taken so much from us. but it is also giving us opportunity to break with past and build back better. 
https://www.who.int/news/item/06-07-2020-who-access-to-hiv-medicines-severely-impacted-by-covid-19-as-aids-response-stalls,seventy three countries have warned that they are at risk of stock outs of antiretroviral arv medicines as result of covid-19 pandemic according to new who survey conducted ahead of international aids societys biannual conference. twenty four countries reported having either critically low stock of arvs or disruptions in supply of these life saving medicines. survey follows modelling exercise convened by who and unaids in may which forecasted that six month disruption in access to arvs could lead to doubling in aids related deaths in sub saharan africa in 2020 alone. in 2019 estimated 8.3 million people were benefiting from arvs in 24 countries now experiencing supply shortages. this represents about one third 33 of all people taking hiv treatment globally. while there is no cure for hiv arvs can control virus and prevent onward sexual transmission to other people.a failure of suppliers to deliver arvs on time and shut down of land and air transport services coupled with limited access to health services within countries as result of pandemic were among causes cited for disruptions in survey.;the findings of this survey are deeply concerning said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. countries and their development partners must do all they can to ensure that people who need hiv treatment continue to access it. we can not let covid-19 pandemic undo hard won gains in global response to this disease. stalled progressaccording to data released today from unaids and who new hiv infections fell by 39 between 2000 and 2019. hiv related deaths fell by 51 over same time period and some 15 million lives were saved through use of antiretroviral therapy. however progresstowards global targets is stalling. over last two years annual number of new hiv infections has plateaued at 1.7 million and there was only modest reduction in hiv related death from 730 000 in 2018 to 690 000 in 2019. despite steady advances in scaling up treatment coverage with more than 25 million people in need of arvs receiving them in 2019 key 2020 global targets will be missed. hiv prevention and testing services are not reaching groups that need them most. improved targeting of proven prevention and testing services will be critical to reinvigorate global response to hiv. who guidance and country actioncovid-19 risks exacerbating situation. who recently developed guidance for countries on how to safely maintain access to essential health services during pandemic including for all people living with or affected by hiv. guidance encourages countries to limit disruptions in access to hiv treatment through multi month dispensing policy whereby medicines are prescribed for longer periods of time up to six months. to date 129 countries have adopted this policy. countries are also mitigating impact of disruptions by working to maintain flights and supply chains engaging communities in delivery of hiv medicines and working with manufacturers to overcome logistics challenges.new opportunities to treat hiv in young childrenat ias conference who will highlight how global progress in reducing hiv related deaths can be accelerated by stepping up support and services for populations disproportionately impacted by epidemic including young children. in 2019 there were estimated 95 000 hiv related deaths and 150 000 new infections among children. only about half 53 of children in need of antiretroviral therapy were receiving it. lack of optimal medicines with suitable pediatric formulations has been longstanding barrier to improving health outcomes for children living with hiv.last month who welcomed decision by u.s. food and drug administration to approve new 5 mg formulation of dolutegravir dtg for infants and children older than 4 weeks and weighing more than 3 kg. this decision will ensure that all children have rapid access to optimal drug that to date has only been available for adults adolescents and older children. who is committed to fast tracking prequalification of dtg as generic drug so that it can be used as soon as possible by countries to save lives. through collaboration of multiple partners we are likely to see generic versions of dolutegravir for children by early 2021 allowing for rapid reduction in cost of this medicine said dr meg doherty director of department of global hiv hepatitis and sti programmes at who. this will give us another new tool to reach children living with hiv and keep them alive and healthy.tackling opportunistic infectionsmany hiv related deaths result from infections that take advantage of individuals weakened immune system. these include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis viral infections like hepatitis and covid-19 parasitic infections such as toxoplasmosis and fungal infections including histoplasmosis.today who is releasing new guidelines for diagnosis and management of histoplasmosis among people living with hiv. histoplasmosis is highly prevalent in who region of americas where as many as 15 600 new cases and 4500 deaths are reported each year among people living with hiv. many of these deaths could be prevented through timely diagnosis and treatment of disease.in recent years development of highly sensitive diagnostic tests has allowed for rapid and accurate confirmation of histoplasmosis and earlier initiation of treatment. however innovative diagnostics and optimal treatments for this disease are not yet widely available in resource limited settings. 
https://www.who.int/news/item/04-07-2020-who-discontinues-hydroxychloroquine-and-lopinavir-ritonavir-treatment-arms-for-covid-19,who today accepted recommendation from solidarity trials international steering committee to discontinue trials hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir ritonavir arms. solidarity trial was established by who to find effective covid-19 treatment for hospitalized patients. international steering committee formulated recommendation in light of evidence for hydroxychloroquine vs standard of care and for lopinavir ritonavir vs standard of care from solidarity trial interim results and from review of evidence from all trials presented at 1 2 july who summit on covid-19 research and innovation. these interim trial results show that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir ritonavir produce little or no reduction in mortality of hospitalized covid-19 patients when compared to standard of care. solidarity trial investigators will interrupt trials with immediate effect. for each of drugs interim results do not provide solid evidence of increased mortality. there were however some associated safety signals in clinical laboratory findings of add on discovery trial participant in solidarity trial. these will also be reported in peer reviewed publication. this decision applies only to conduct of solidarity trial in hospitalized patients and does not affect possible evaluation in other studies of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir ritonavir in non hospitalized patients or as pre- or post exposure prophylaxis for covid-19. interim solidarity results are now being readied for peer reviewed publication.
