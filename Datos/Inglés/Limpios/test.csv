the covid-19 pandemic is highlighting the need to urgently increase investment in services for mental health or risk a massive increase in mental health conditions in the coming months according to a policy brief on covid-19 and mental health issued by the united nations today.the impact of the pandemic on peoples mental health is already extremely concerning said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general of the world health organization. social isolation fear of contagion and loss of family members is compounded by the distress caused by loss of income and often employment.depression and anxiety are increasingreports already indicate an increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety in a number of countries. a study in ethiopia in april 2020 reported a 3-fold increase in the prevalence of symptoms of depression compared to estimates from ethiopia before the epidemic.specific population groups are at particular risk of covid related psychological distress. frontline health care workers faced with heavy workload life or death decisions and risk of infection are particularly affected. during the pandemic in china health care workers have reported high rates of depression 50 anxiety 45 and insomnia 34 and in canada 47 of health care workers have reported a need for psychological support.children and adolescents are also at risk. parents in italy and spain have reported that their children have had difficulties concentrating as well as irritability restlessness and nervousness. stay at home measures have come with a heightened risk of children witnessing or suffering violence and abuse. children with disabilities children in crowded settings and those who live and work on the streets are particularly vulnerable.other groups that are at particular risk are women particularly those who are juggling home schooling working from home and household tasks older persons and people with pre existing mental health conditions. a study carried out with young people with a history of mental health needs living in the uk reports that 32 of them agreed that the pandemic had made their mental health much worse.an increase in alcohol consumption is another area of concern for mental health experts. statistics from canada report that 20 of 15 49 year olds have increased their alcohol consumption during the pandemic.mental health services interruptedthe increase in people in need of mental health or psychosocial support has been compounded by the interruption to physical and mental health services in many countries. in addition to the conversion of mental health facilities into care facilities for people with covid-19 care systems have been affected by mental health staff being infected with the virus and the closing of face to face services. community services such as self help groups for alcohol and drug dependence have in many countries been unable to meet for several months.it is now crystal clear that mental health needs must be treated as a core element of our response to and recovery from the covid-19 pandemic said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus. this is a collective responsibility of governments and civil society with the support of the whole united nations system. a failure to take peoples emotional well being seriously will lead to long term social and economic costs to society.finding ways to provide servicesin concrete terms it is critical that people living with mental health conditions have continued access to treatment. changes in approaches to provision of mental health care and psychosocial support are showing signs of success in some countries. in madrid when more than 60 of mental health beds were converted to care for people with covid-19 where possible people with severe conditions were moved to private clinics to ensure continuity of care. local policy makers identified emergency psychiatry as an essential service to enable mental health care workers to continue outpatient services over the phone. home visits were organized for the most serious cases. teams from egypt kenya nepal malaysia and new zealand among others have reported creating increased capacity of emergency telephone lines for mental health to reach people in need.support for community actions that strengthen social cohesion and reduce loneliness particularly for the most vulnerable such as older people must continue. such support is required from government local authorities the private sector and members of the general public with initiatives such as provision of food parcels regular phone check ins with people living alone and organization of online activities for intellectual and cognitive stimulation.an opportunity to build back betterthe scaling up and reorganization of mental health services that is now needed on a global scale is an opportunity to build a mental health system that is fit for the future said vora kestrel director of the department of mental health and substance use at who. this means developing and funding national plans that shift care away from institutions to community services ensuring coverage for mental health conditions in health insurance packages and building the human resource capacity to deliver quality mental health and social care in the community.,1

all over the world the covid-19 pandemic is causing significant loss of life disrupting livelihoods and threatening the recent advances in health and progress towards global development goals highlighted in the 2020 world health statistics published by the world health organization who today.the good news is that people around the world are living longer and healthier lives. the bad news is the rate of progress is too slow to meet the sustainable development goals and will be further thrown off track by covid-19 said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director-general.the pandemic highlights the urgent need for all countries to invest in strong health systems and primary health care as the best defense against outbreaks like covid-19 and against the many other health threats that people around the world face every day. health systems and health security are two sides of the same coin.whos world health statistics an annual check up on the worlds health reports progress against a series of key health and health service indicators revealing some important lessons in terms of progress made towards the sustainable development goals and gaps to fill.life expectancy and healthy life expectancy have increased but unequally.the biggest gains were reported in low income countries which saw life expectancy rise 21 or 11 years between 2000 and 2016 compared with an increase of 4 or 3 years in higher income countries).one driver of progress in lower income countries was improved access to services to prevent and treat hiv malaria and tuberculosis as well as number of neglected tropical diseases such as guinea worm. another was better maternal and child healthcare which led to a having of child mortality between 2000 and 2018.but in a number of areas progress has been stalling. immunization coverage has barely increased in recent years and there are fears that malaria gains may be reversed. and there is an overall shortage of services within and outside the health system to prevent and treat noncommunicable diseases nces such as cancer diabetes heart and lung disease and stroke. in 2016 71 per cent of all deaths worldwide were attributable to nces with the majority of the 15 million premature deaths 85 occurring in low and middle income countries.this uneven progress broadly mirrors inequalities in access to quality health services. only between one third and one half the worlds population was able to obtain essential health services in 2017. service coverage in low- and middle income countries remains well below coverage in wealthier ones as do health workforce densities. in more than 40 of all countries there are fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10 000 people. over 55 of countries have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10 000 people.the inability to pay for healthcare is another major challenge for many. on current trends who estimates that this year 2020 approximately 1 billion people almost 13 per cent of the global population will be spending at least 10 of their household budgets on health care. the majority of these people live in lower middle income countries.the covid-19 pandemic highlights the need to protect people from health emergencies as well as to promote universal health coverage and healthier populations to keep people from needing health services through multisecotral interventions like improving basic hygiene and sanitation said dr samira alma assistant director general at who.in 2017 more than half 55 of the global population was estimated to lack access to safely managed sanitation services and more than one quarter 29 lacked safely managed drinking water. in the same year two in five households globally 40 lacked basic handwashing facilities with soap and water in their home.the world health statistics also highlight the need for stronger data and health information systems. uneven capacities to collect and use accurate timely and comparable health statistics undermining countries ability to understand population health trends develop appropriate policies allocate resources and prioritize interventions.for almost a fifth of countries over half of the key indicators have no recent primary or direct underlying data another major challenge in enabling countries to prepare for prevent and respond to health emergencies such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. who is therefore supporting countries in strengthening surveillance and data and health information systems so they can measure their status and manage improvements.the message from this report is clear as the world battles the most serious pandemic in 100 years just a decade away from the sig deadline we must act together to strengthen primary health care and focus on the most vulnerable among us in order to eliminate the gross inequalities that dictate who lives a long healthy life and who does nt added alma. we will only succeed in doing this by helping countries to improve their data and health information systems.note for editorsthe world health statistics have been compiled primarily from publications and databases produced and maintained by who or by united nations un groups of which who is a member such as the un interagency group for child mortality estimation. in addition some statistics have been derived from data produced and maintained by other international organizations such as the un department of economic and social affairs and its population division. the global health observatory database contains additional details about the health related sig indicators as well as interactive visualization.,1
